# WordPress Learning Portfolio Site

This is a one-page portfolio site built using WordPress, showcasing my personal projects and skills. It is a simpler version of my actual portfolio, found here ()[]. The site is built with a custom theme and includes customizations made to the functions.php file and template files. It also utilizes popular WordPress plugins, Yoast for SEO optimization and WPForms for contact forms.

Working with WordPress for this portfolio site has provided me with valuable experience and preparation for potential professional work with WordPress in the future. Although the site doesn't utilize the CMS features of WordPress, it allowed me to gain insights into various aspects of WordPress, such as theme customization and usage of popular plugins like Yoast for SEO optimization and WPForms for contact forms. It has helped me understand the fundamentals of WordPress as a content management system (CMS), and I have honed my skills in working with custom CSS to achieve the desired design and layout.

The site is deployed on Github Pages, using the Simply Static plugin.
